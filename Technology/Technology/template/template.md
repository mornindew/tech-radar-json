# Technology Template

This is the decription of technology and the **business value** that it will solve. In addition to the business value, you need to provide the main components of the technology and how we will use it.

## Business Value
Provide the business Value - this needs to not be things like the tech is cool.  More what our customers could do with this technology and the value that it provides.

## Cost 

Any links to the cost model for the technology (if there is one)

# Overview Diagrams

If there are any overview diagrams needed to explain the technology then this is the place to put it.

# Standards - All coding standards that we use

If the technology requires standards then this is the place to put it

## Patterns and Anti-Patterns

|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
|Composition vs Inheritance |Prefer composition over inheritance            |Unnecessary complicated inheritance structures            |This will complicate your code            |
|Quotes                     |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |            |

## Training Materials

Any training materials that are needed with links.  The point is **NOT** to write training materials.  It is to send people to places to learn.  If you found any resources useful when learning then link them here

## Sample Repos

This is any sample repos for the technology, these could be internal sample repos or external sample repos
